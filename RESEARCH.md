### Abstract and results:
The work discusses accuracy of different classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Discriminant Analysis (DA). As a result, it proposes utilizing a KNN classifier for very efficient fruit image classification, achieving an accuracy of 93.103%, and recommends integrating the methodology with a weighing machine to expedite billing by capturing a sample fruit image for algorithmic classification, while highlighting the importance of improving specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) to address real-time challenges, suggesting enhanced performance for evaluating mixed fruits through increased training with such images.
### Methodology
**Data set** (`Training Img data`, `Testing Img data`) -> **Preprocessing** (`Resizin`, `gray scale`, `edge protection`) -> **Feature extraction** (`Color`, `Binarization`, `Border`, `Texture`, `Threshold`) -> **Classifier** -> **Result**

### Abstract and results:
This work introduces a high-performance deep learning method for automatically classifying vegetable images. The study employs the AlexNet network model in Caffe, utilizing ImageNet data for training and testing. The use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) in the output function accelerates network training, and dropout technology enhances model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that, with varying amounts of training data, the deep learning method achieves a 92.1% accuracy rate on the test set.
### Methodology
**Dataset** (`ImageNet`,`24000 images after data expansion`, `80% train`, `20% test`, `5 classes`) -> **Preprocessing** (`rotation`, `resize - 80x80`) -> **Classifier** (`Caffe Framework`, `AlexNet CNN`, `Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)`) -> **Result**
