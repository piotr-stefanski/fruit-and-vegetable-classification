### Abstract and results:
The work discusses accuracy of different classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Discriminant Analysis (DA). As a result, it proposes utilizing a KNN classifier for very efficient fruit image classification, achieving an accuracy of 93.103%, and recommends integrating the methodology with a weighing machine to expedite billing by capturing a sample fruit image for algorithmic classification, while highlighting the importance of improving specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) to address real-time challenges, suggesting enhanced performance for evaluating mixed fruits through increased training with such images.
### Methodology
**Data set** (`Training Img data`, `Testing Img data`) -> **Preprocessing** (`Resizin`, `gray scale`, `edge protection`) -> **Feature extraction** (`Color`, `Binarization`, `Border`, `Texture`, `Threshold`) -> **Classifier** -> **Result**
